Significance of Attachment

> *We’re born to connect, and as long as we live we never stop needing connection. It affects us from the cradle to the grave.*
> 
- Only through interdependence do we become our strongest and most authentic selves
- Harry Reis, in his university lecture, had said that from these early experiences we form beliefs or “mental models” about what to expect in relationships and how to behave in relationships, and that these stay with us throughout our lives. These mental models persist, Harry explained, because they create “patterns in the brain” and channel our behavior.
- if they were shown a blue circle, they knew they were safe, but if they were shown a red X, they knew there was a 20 percent chance that after a period of time they’d get an electric shock on their ankle. “We were making them very anxious!” he said. The subjects did this under three conditions: while holding the hand of a stranger, while alone, and while holding the hand of their romantic partner.
“And here’s what we found,” he said. “If you’re alone and in a tube and it’s very loud and you’re under threat of electric shock, your brain lights up like a Christmas tree.” The brain has a lot to do, he explained: hating the experience, wanting to escape, but also self-regulating so you don’t actually bolt from the machine.
If you’re holding a stranger’s hand, he said, parts of the brain associated with physical arousal, including heart rate and mobilizing the body to take action, are somewhat less active.
But if you’re holding your partner’s hand, he said, “We see massive decreases in the way the brain responds.” People felt less threatened and didn’t exercise regions of the brain for self-regulation and release of stress hormones. Instead, the hand-holding—if the relationship was good—seemed to take care of that.
- The attachment behavioral system is largely about the management of fear.
- “maternity sensitivity scale” based on three precepts: that the mother perceives a baby’s signals, interprets them correctly, and responds appropriately
- As with all parenting, sometimes it was exhausting, but it was also exhilarating and remains the most rewarding and happiest part of both of our lives.
- “Attachment theory raises the question of how well a society creates ‘persons.’”
- Recognize That We Are All Creatures Who Need to Attach
- if you want to feel how a baby sees its mother, listen to Joe Cocker singing “You Are So Beautiful” as if it were sung to the mother by her child.

## Origin of Attachments

> *“The formation of a bond is described as falling in love”
“The romantic love is an adult form of attachment”*
> 
- The attachment system was designed,” he explained, “to do one very simple thing: to create and keep physical closeness between infant and caregiver. Infants who displayed these behaviors and caregivers who responded were the ones whose genes were more likely to survive to the next generation. Infants who didn’t do it, who said, in effect, ‘pretty tiger’ and wanted to go talk to the tiger, or caregivers who were more concerned about themselves and didn’t go to pick up the infant, their genes did not get passed on
- In the first years of life . . . a child extracts patterns from his relationships . . . [and] stores an impression of what love feels like.
- John Bowlby wrote: “The formation of a bond is described as falling in love, maintaining a bond as loving someone, and losing a partner as grieving over someone.” To be sure, adult romance is not only about attachment—other factors come into play—but attachment is an essential part.
- Drawing on the writings of John Bowlby, she concluded—as had other leading researchers—that romantic love is an adult form of attachment. As such, love exists for the same reason the infant-parent bond exists: when we emotionally bond with loved ones, they become our safe havens and secure bases.
- Love is “the best survival mechanism there is,” Johnson has written. It “drives us to bond emotionally with a precious few others who offer us safe haven from the storms of life.” This need for safe, emotional connection is “wired into our genes” by millions of years of evolution and is as basic to health and happiness as the drives for food, shelter, or sex.
- Frightening events, illness and injury, and threat of separation—situations that John Bowlby believed activate the attachment system

### The Physiological Initiative of Attachment Style

The success or failure of that search actually shapes the infant’s developing brain, affecting core emotions and personality structure, and thus creating a set of beliefs and expectations about relationships in general.

## Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)

> Consists of 20 open ended questions designed “to surprise the unconsciousness”. Is performed by professionally trained therapists.
> 
- the “adjectival constellation” the person is asked to provide on the spot is a synopsis of the “general nature of the childhood relationship.” Once the adjectives have been given, the person has in effect “taken a stance” as to the kind of relationship he or she had with that parent. Then the person will be “systematically prodded” for specific memories to support the selection of each word.
- Question Lists (incomplete)
    1. Describe your relationship with your parents.
    2. Think of five adjectives that reflect your relationship with your mother.
    3. What's the first time you remember being separated from your parents?
    4. Did you ever feel rejected?
    5. Did you experience the loss of someone close to you?
    6. How do you think your experience affected your adult personality?
